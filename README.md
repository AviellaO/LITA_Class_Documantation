### Project Title: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
---
Ecommerce analytics is the process of accumulating data from all of the areas that have an impact on your store. You can then use this data to comprehend shifts in customer behavior and online shopping trends — ultimately leading to better business decisions, wiser budget allocations, a frictionless customer experience (by identifying where customers drop off in the funnel), and more personalized marketing. 

### Data Sources
---
First thing you need to know is you need God and you have God. There’s an access you have with God already, it is now left to you to make good use of the access. You can’t do this with whatever advice I give but I can assure you that you will excel with God’s wisdom guiding you.
